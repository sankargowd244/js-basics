<div id="empleft">
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;line-height:25px; font-size:15px;">A global 100 company managed their only shared services center for 5000+ employees out of Bangalore. The center manages strategic initiatives for multiple business lines across operations around the world. All the internal and external platforms that drive their global operations are managed by multiple teams out of Bangalore.

Planning for such a complicated operation involved a dedicated team, multiple vendors and active participation of all employees on a recurring basis. Employees found existing systems complicated and this resulted in partial planning.</p>

<li><div id="r">15%</div><div id="d">The process fail rate was as high as 15%.</d><li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;line-height:25px;font-size:15px;">Myfriday was rolled out to employees. Being an extremely simple solution, it did not require any training. Employees on an average spent only 3 minutes a week. Myfriday gave the employees prompt automated updates, notifications and confirmations. Myfriday gave the employee what he wanted  a mechanism to give feedback, complain, rate and look up past transactions.</p>
